## Lecture 2: Advanced Google Search Console Features

### Topics Covered:
4. URL Parameter Feature in Google Search Console
5. What are Enhancement Reports in Google Search Console
6. What are Manual Actions & Security Insights in Google Search Console
7. Check Backlinks in Google Search Console

## 4. URL Parameter Feature in Google Search Console

### What are URL Parameters?
URL parameters are additional information added to the end of a URL after a question mark (?). They help websites track user behavior, filter content, or customize page views.

### Common URL Parameter Examples:
- **Tracking parameters**: `?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc`
- **Session IDs**: `?sessionid=12345`
- **Sorting parameters**: `?sort=price&order=asc`
- **Pagination**: `?page=2`
- **Product filters**: `?color=red&size=large`

### Why URL Parameters Matter for SEO:

#### Duplicate Content Issues:
- **Same content, different URLs** can confuse search engines
- **Diluted ranking signals** across multiple URLs
- **Crawl budget waste** on unnecessary parameter combinations

#### Indexing Problems:
- **Unwanted pages** in search results
- **Confusing user experience** with multiple similar URLs
- **Link equity distribution** across parameter variations

### How to Access URL Parameters in GSC:
1. **Legacy Search Console**: Available under Search Traffic > URL Parameters
2. **New Search Console**: Feature was removed but recommendations provided via other reports

### Parameter Handling Options (Legacy):

#### Let Googlebot Decide:
- **Default setting** for most parameters
- **Google automatically** determines parameter importance
- **Recommended** for most websites

#### No URLs:
- **Tells Google** not to crawl URLs with this parameter
- **Use carefully** - can block important pages
- **Best for** tracking parameters with no content value

#### Every URL:
- **Crawl all variations** of the parameter
- **Increases crawl budget** usage
- **Only use** when parameter creates unique content

#### Representative URLs:
- **Crawl few URLs** with the parameter
- **Balanced approach** between coverage and efficiency
- **Good for** sorting or filtering parameters

### Modern Approach (Without Legacy Tool):

#### Canonical Tags:
```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/products/shoes/" />
```
- **Specify preferred URL** version
- **Consolidate link equity**
- **Prevent duplicate content** issues

#### Robots.txt:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /*?sessionid=
Disallow: /*?sort=
```
- **Block unwanted parameters** from crawling
- **Use wildcards** for parameter patterns
- **Test thoroughly** before implementation

#### URL Structure Optimization:
- **Clean URL design** without unnecessary parameters
- **Server-side rendering** for filter states
- **AJAX implementation** for dynamic content

### Best Practices:

#### Parameter Audit:
- **Identify all parameters** used on your site
- **Categorize by function** (tracking, filtering, sorting)
- **Assess SEO impact** of each parameter type

#### Implementation Strategy:
- **Use canonical tags** for parameter handling
- **Implement proper redirects** for clean URLs
- **Monitor crawl budget** impact
- **Track indexing** of parameter URLs
